i. Project Title: sprint0

ii. Getting Started

	I first created the github repository and followed the onscreen instructions to initialize it, these instructions involved creating a README.md file in the same branch as the other files; Section 1.1, Section 3.1, Section 5.1. So After I made the first commit and pushing all those files, I removed README.md from the local repo, made the commit and pushed it.
